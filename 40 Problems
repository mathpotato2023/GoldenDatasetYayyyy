    "problem": "A positive integer has exactly $929$ digits. It satisfies the following properties:\n(a) Every pair of consecutive digits forms a two-digit number divisible by $13$.\n(b) The last digit of the integer is $2$.\nWhat is the first digit of the integer?",
    "solution": "Working backwards, we determine which digits can precede a given digit so that the resulting two-digit number is divisible by $13$. If the units digit is $2$, the tens digit must be $5$ since $52$ is divisible by $13$. If the units digit is $5$, the tens digit must be $6$ since $65$ is divisible by $13$. If the units digit is $6$, the tens digit must be $2$ since $26$ is divisible by $13$. Thus the digits repeat in the cycle $652$ when read from right to left.\n\nSince the number has $929$ digits and the last digit corresponds to the first digit of the repeating block, we compute $929 \\bmod 3 = 2$. Therefore, the first digit is the second digit in the cycle $6,5,2$, which is $5$."

    "solution": "Label the people $1,2,\\dots,100$ around the circle. For each person, there are exactly two choices for which animal faces up. Fix an arbitrary initial configuration. For each adjacent pair, define a \"conflict\" if both people show the same animal.\n\nNow flip the card of person $i$ if doing so reduces the number of conflicts involving neighbors $i-1$ and $i+1$. Since flipping a card affects only the two adjacent conflicts, and since the total number of conflicts is finite, this process must eventually terminate.\n\nAt termination, no single flip can reduce the number of conflicts. This implies that there are no conflicts at all; otherwise flipping one of the people involved in a conflict would reduce the total. Hence, a configuration with no two neighboring animals the same must exist."

    "solution": "Divide the $31$ coins into three groups of $10$, $10$, and $11$. First weigh the two groups of $10$ against each other.\n\nIf they balance, then the counterfeit coin is in the group of $11$. Compare one coin from the group of $11$ with a known authentic coin from the balanced group. The result reveals whether the counterfeit is heavier or lighter.\n\nIf the two groups of $10$ do not balance, then the counterfeit coin is in one of these two groups. Take one coin from each of the unbalanced groups and compare them in the second weighing. If they balance, the counterfeit is in the remaining coins and its nature is determined by the first weighing.

    "solution": "The total number of games is $\\binom{8}{2}=28$, so the total number of points distributed is $28$. Let the players be ranked $1$ through $8$ with distinct scores.\n\nLet the runner-up have score $S_2$. The combined scores of players $5$ through $8$ is also $S_2$. Since scores are strictly decreasing, each of players $5$ through $8$ must have strictly less than $S_2/4$.\n\nThis severely restricts the distribution of wins and ties. A careful case analysis shows that the match between the $3$rd- and $5$th-ranked players cannot be a draw, since a draw would force equalities or contradictions in the score ordering.\n\nThus, the only possible outcomes are a win for the $3$rd-ranked player or a win for the $5$th-ranked player.
